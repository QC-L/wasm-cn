# 道德规范和职业准则

WebAssembly 依赖 W3C 的[道德规范和职业准则][Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct]：

> W3C is a growing and global community where participants choose to work
> together, and in that process experience differences in language, location,
> nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings
> and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In
> rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one
> or more people in the community, which W3C will not tolerate.
>
> A Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is useful to define accepted and
> acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional
> practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a
> vehicle for better identity of the organization.

我们希望我们社区能够遵守这个规范，如果你发现有任何代码违背了这些原则，你可以通过邮件 `team-webassembly-chairs@w3.org` 联系社区（注意：邮件也会被 W3C 员工看到），特别注意的是 W3C 有相关 [规章制度][procedures] 可以使你直接联系到申诉员
